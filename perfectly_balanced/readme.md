Do this kata after having done [[020] Stack data structure](https://github.com/saltpay/code-katas/discussions/29)

Given a string containing opening and closing braces, check if it represents a balanced expression or not.

For example,
`{[{}{}]}[()]`, `{{}{}}`, `[]{}()` are balanced expressions.

`{()}[)`, `{(})` are not balanced.

Hint: use the stack data structure.
