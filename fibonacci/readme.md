The Fibonacci sequence, named after mathematician Fibonacci, is a sequence of numbers that looks like this:

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...`

You get first two starting numbers, `0` and `1`, and the next number in the sequence is always the sum of the previous two numbers.

Write a function `fib`, that takes one parameter `n`, and returns the `n`th number from the Fibonacci sequence, counting from `0`.

For example:

`fib(0)` returns `0`
`fib(4)` returns `3`
`fib(15)` returns `610`

Note: Can your program compute `fib(92)`?
